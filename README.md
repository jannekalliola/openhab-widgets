# openhab-widgets
Some OpenHAB widgets I've found from the net and then improved to fit my needs. To keep track of my changes, I've added them to this repository. Hopefully someone else finds them useful, too.

The repository contains the following widgets. **N.B.** The widgets are separate from each others, I just happen to use them all and thus have collected them together.

Read the separate README.md files in each widget directory for more information.

* **MultiState** â€“ provides a handy widget to control a group of switches or rollershutters.
